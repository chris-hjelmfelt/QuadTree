Encodes an image by finding regions of pixels within an image that are of similar light intensity. 

A school project from October 2015
with partner Cheldon Coughlen

Usage (Linux):
> ./quadTree lena.bmp 32
try running this with different factors (3rd argument) to get different levels of compression with different data loss.
Run any image that is 512px x 512px 24-bit bmp 


If application needs to be compiled:
See if you have GLUT installed
> ls /usr/include/GL
if glut.h is there you should be good.
Otherwise download:
> sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
Make the application:
> make
